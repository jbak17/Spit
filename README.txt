Gameplay: how is this going to work? 

Set up:
	DealCards: 
		Dealer deals cards to players; 
		players create layout for themselves;
		Dealer requests a card from each player;
		Dealer adds those cards to initial pile;

	StartGame

The dealer reports what the two cards are;

If a player has an eligible card they send it to the dealer;

If the dealer accepts the card the dealer sends a new message to the players saying what the current card is;

If the dealer gets a card that is ineligible it is returned to sender;

If neither player can pass a card the dealer requests a new card from the deck of each player; 

If a layout is empty it signals the dealer to end the game;
